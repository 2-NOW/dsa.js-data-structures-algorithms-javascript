=== Tree
(((Tree)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Tree)))
A tree is a non-linear data structure where a node can have zero or more connections. The topmost node in a tree is called *root*. The linked nodes to the root are called *children* or *descendants*.

.Tree Data Structure: root node and descendants.

As you can see in the picture above, this data structure resembles an inverted tree hence the name. It starts with a *root* node and *branch* off with its descendants, and finally *leaves*.

==== Implementing a Tree

Implementing a tree is not too hard. It’s similar to a <<part02-linear-data-structures#linked-list>>. The main difference is that instead of having a `next` and `previous` links, we have an infinite number of linked nodes (children/descendants).

Simple! Right? But there are some constraints that you have to keep at all times.

.Tree data structures constraints
1. *Loops*: You have to be careful *not* to make a circular loop. Otherwise, this wouldn’t be a tree anymore but a <<part03-graph-data-structures#graph, graph data structure>>! E.g., Node A has B as a child, then Node B list Node A as its descendant forming a loop. ‍️
2.  *Parents*: A node with more than two parents. Again, if that happens is no longer a tree but a <<part03-graph-data-structures#graph>>.
3.  *Root*: a tree must have only one root. Two non-connected parts are not a tree. <<part03-graph-data-structures#graph>> can have non-connected portions and doesn’t have root.

==== Basic concepts

.Here’s a summary of the three basic concepts:
* The topmost node is called *root*.
* A node’s immediate linked nodes are called *children*.
* A *leaf* or *terminal node* is a node without any descendant or children.
* A node immediate ancestor is called *parent*. Yep, and like a family tree, a node can have *uncles* and *siblings*, and *grandparents*.
* *Internal nodes* are all nodes except for the leaf nodes and the root node.
* The connection/link between nodes is called *edge*.
* The *height of a _tree_* is the distance (edge count) from the farthest leaf to the root.
* The *height of a _node_* is obtained by counting the edges between the _node_ and the most distant leaf. For instance, from the image above:

** Node A has a height of 3.
** Node G has a height of 1.
** Node I has a height of 0.

* The *depth of a tree* is the distance (edge count) from the root to the farthest leaf.

==== Types of Binary Trees

There are different kinds of trees depending on the restrictions. E.g. The trees that have two children or less are called *binary tree*, while trees with at most three children are called *Ternary Tree*. Since binary trees are most common we are going to cover them here and others in another chapter.

===== Binary Tree
(((Binary Tree)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Binary Tree)))
The binary restricts the nodes to have at most two children. Trees, in general, can have 3, 4, 23 or more, but not binary trees.

.Binary tree has at most 2 children while non-binary trees can have more.

Binary trees are one of the most used kinds of tree, and they are used to build other data structures.

[[bst]]
===== Binary Search Tree (BST)
(((Binary Search Tree)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Binary Search Tree)))
The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialization of the binary tree. BST has the same restriction as a binary tree; each node has at most two children. However, there’s another restriction: the values are ordered. It means the left child’s value has to be less or equal than the parent. In turn, the right child’s value has to be bigger than the parent.

> BST: left ≤ parent < right

===== Binary Heap
(((Binary Heap)))
(((Heap)))
(((Max-Heap)))
(((Min-Heap)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Binary Heap)))
The heap (max-heap) is a type of binary tree where the parent's value is higher than the value of both children. Opposed to the BST, the left child doesn’t have to be smaller than the right child.

.Heap vs BST
image::image34.png[image,width=325,height=176]

The (max) heap has the maximum value in the root, while BST doesn’t.

There are two kinds of heaps: min-heap and max-heap.
For a *max-heap*, the root has the highest value. The heap guarantee that as you move away from the root, the values get smaller. The opposite is true for a *min-heap*. In a min-heap, the lowest value is at the root, and as you go down the lower to the descendants, they will keep increasing values.

.Max-heap keeps the highest value at the top while min-heap keep the lowest at the root.

.Heap vs. Binary Search Tree
****
Heap is better at finding max or min values in constant time *O(1)*, while a balanced BST is good a finding any element in *O(log n)*. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues while BST is used when you need every value sorted.

===== Binary Tree Diameter

*BT-1*) _Find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a tree is defined as the longest possible path from two nodes (it doesn't need to include the root). The lenth of diameter is calculated by couting the number of edges on the path._
