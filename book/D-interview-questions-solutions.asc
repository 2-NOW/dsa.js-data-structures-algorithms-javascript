[#array-q-max-subarray]
include::content/part02/array.asc[tag=array-q-max-subarray]

The first step is making sure we understand the problem well. Let's do basic examples:

----
A = [-5, 6, 9, -8]
B = [-1, 6, -3, 8]
----

What's the subarray with the maximum sum? For A, it will be `[6, 9]` and for B, it will be `[6, -3, 8]`.

We could generate all possible subarrays, add them up, and then pick the max number.

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/max-subarray.js[tag=maxSubArrayBrute1]
----

This code is simple to understand; however, not very efficient. The runtime is `O(n^3)`.

Notice we're adding up the numbers from `i` to `j` on each cycle. But, we can optimize this. We can keep a local variable and add the new number to it. That way, we don't have to revisit previous numbers.

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/max-subarray.js[tag=maxSubArrayBrute2]
----

The runtime is much better: `O(n)`. Can we still do better?

We can use a greedy approach, where do one pass through the array. We only add the numbers if their sum is larger than just taking the current element.

[source, javascript]

The runtime is `O(n)` and the space complexity of `O(1)`.




[#array-q-buy-sell-stock]
include::content/part02/array.asc[tag=array-q-buy-sell-stock]

There are multiple examples that we can simulate: bear markets (when prices are going down), bullish markets (when prices are going up), and zig-zag markets (when prices are going up and down).

[source, javascript]
----
// zig-zag market
maxProfit([5, 10, 5, 10]); // => 5
// bullish market
maxProfit([1, 2, 3]); // => 2
// bearish market
maxProfit([3, 2, 1]); // => 0
----

During the bearish markets, the profit will always be 0. Since if you buy, we are only going to lose.

We can do a brute force solution doing all combinations:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/buy-sell-stock.js[tag=maxProfitBrute1]
----

The runtime for this solution is `O(n^2)`.

A better solution is to eliminate the 2nd for loop and only do one pass.

Algorithm:

- Do one pass through all the prices
    ** Keep track of the minimum price seen so far.
    ** calculate `profit = currentPrice - minPriceSoFar`
    ** Keep track of the maximun profit seen so far.
- Return maxProfit.

[source, javascript]

The runtime is `O(n)` and the space complexity of `O(1)`.

=== Solutions for Linked List Questions
(((Interview Questions Solutions, Linked Lists)))

:leveloffset: -1




[#linkedlist-q-merge-lists]
include::content/part02/linked-list.asc[tag=linkedlist-q-merge-lists]

We need to visit each node in both lists and merge them in ascending order. Note: We don't need to copy the values nor create new nodes.

Another case to take into consideration is that lists might have different lengths. So, if one list runs out, we have to keep taking elements from the remaining list.

*Algorithm*:

- Have a pointer for each list
- While there's a pointer that is not null, visite them
    ** Compare each list node's value and take the smaller one.
    ** Advance the pointer of the taken node to the next one.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/merge-lists.js[tags=description;solution]
----

Notice that we used a "dummy" node or "sentinel node" to have some starting point for the final list.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(m+n)`. Visiting each node from the list 1 and list 2 has a time complexity `O(m + n)`. `m` and `n` represent each list's length.
- Space: `O(1)`. We reuse the same nodes and only change their `next` pointers. We only create one additional node, "the sentinel node."


[#linkedlist-q-linkedlist-same-data]
include::content/part02/linked-list.asc[tag=linkedlist-q-linkedlist-same-data]

We are given two linked lists that contain string data. We want to know if the concatenated strings from each list are the same.

The tricky part is that the same data can be distributed differently on the linked lists:

----
L1: he -> ll -> o
L2: h -> e -> llo
----

One naive approach could be to go through each list's node and concatenate the strings. Then, we can check if they are equal.

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/linkedlist-same-data.js[tag=hasSameDataBrute1]
----

Notice that the problem mentions that lists could be huge (millions of nodes). If the first character on each list is different, we are unnecessarily computing millions of nodes, when a straightforward check will do the job.

A better way to solve this problem is iterating over each character on both lists, and when we found a mismatch, we return `false` immediately. If they are the same, we still have to visit all of them.

*Algorithm*:

- Set a pointer to iterate over each node in the lists.
- For each node, have an index (starting at zero) and compare if both lists have the same data.
    ** When the index reaches the last character on the current node, we move to the next node.
    ** If we found that a character from one list doesn't match the other, we return `false`.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/linkedlist-same-data.js[tags=description;solution]
----

The function `findNextPointerIndex` is a helper to navigate each character on a linked list.
Notice that we increase the index (`i + 1`) on each iteration.
If the index overflows, it moves to the next node and reset the index to zero.



*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`. We go over all the characters on each list
- Space: `O(1)`. Only using pointers and no auxiliary data structures.

=== Solutions for Stack Questions
(((Interview Questions Solutions, Stack)))

:leveloffset: -1

[#stack-q-valid-parentheses]
include::content/part02/stack.asc[tag=stack-q-valid-parentheses]

.We need to validate that brackets are properly opened and closed, following these rules:
- An opened bracket must be close by the same type.
- Open brackets mush be closed in the correct order.

This is a parsing problem, and usually, stacks are good candidates for them.

*Algorithm*:

- Create a mapping for each opening bracket to its closing counterpart.
- Iterate through the string
    ** When we found an opening bracket, insert the corresponding closing bracket into the stack.
    ** When we found a closing bracket, pop from the stack and make sure it corresponds to the current character.
- Check the stack is empty. If there's a leftover, it means that something didn't close properly.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/valid-parentheses.js[tag=description]
include::interview-questions/valid-parentheses.js[tag=solution]
----

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`. We iterate over each character of the string.
- Space: `O(n)`. We use an auxiliary stack.



[#stack-q-daily-temperatures]
include::content/part02/stack.asc[tag=stack-q-daily-temperatures]

The first solution that might come to mind it's using two for loops. For each element, we have visit each temperature ahead to find a bigger one.

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/daily-temperatures.js[tag=dailyTemperaturesBrute1]
----

This solution is an `O(n^2)`. Can we do better? We can!

Here's an idea: start backward, so we know when there's a warmer temperature beforehand. The last element is always 0 (because there are no more temperatures ahead of it). We can place each element's index that we visit on a stack. If the current weather is bigger than the stack top, we remove it until a bigger one remains or the stack is empty. If the stack has a value, we calculate the number of days ahead. Otherwise, it is 0.

*Algorithm*:

- Traverse the daily temperatures backward
  ** Push each temperature to a stack.
  ** While the current temperature is larger than the one at the top of the stack, pop it.
  ** If the stack is empty, then there's no warmer weather ahead, so it's 0.
  ** If the stack has an element, calculate the index delta.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/daily-temperatures.js[tag=description]
include::interview-questions/daily-temperatures.js[tag=solution]
----

The stack contains the indexes rather than the temperatures themselves.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`. We visit each element on the array once.
- Space: `O(1)`. The worst-case scenario is ascending order without duplicates. The stack will hold at most 70 items (100 - 30). If we didn't have the range restriction, then space complexity would be `O(n)`.

=== Solutions for Queue Questions
(((Interview Questions Solutions, Queue)))

:leveloffset: -1


[#queue-q-recent-counter]
include::content/part02/queue.asc[tag=queue-q-recent-counter]

We are asked to keep track of the request's count only within a given time window. A queue is a perfect application for this. We can add any new request to the  Queue. Also, we need to check if the oldest element is outside the time window. If so, we remove it from the queue.

*Algorithm*:

- Enqueue new requests.
- Take a `peek` at the oldest request in the queue.
- While `current timestamp - oldest timestamp`, dequeue the oldest.
- Return the length of the queue.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/recent-counter.js[tags=description;solution]
----

Notice that we enqueue every request, and then we check all the ones that have "expire" and remove them from the queue.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of requests. One Enqueue/Dequeue operation is O(1). However, we might run into a worst-case where all requests have to be dequeued.
- Space: `O(W)`, where `W` is the time window. We can have at most W requests in the queue since they are in increasing order without duplicates.


[#queue-q-design-snake-game]
include::content/part02/queue.asc[tag=queue-q-design-snake-game]

This game is perfect to practice working with Queues. There are at least two opportunities to use a Queue. You can enqueue the food location, and also you can keep the snake's body parts on a Queue. We insert a new position into the snake's queue on every move and dequeue the last location to indicate the snake moved. Every time the snake eats food, it grows one more unit. The food gets dequeue, and we place the next food location (if any).

*Algorithm*:

- Based on the snake's head current position, calculate the next location based on the given move `direction`.
- If the new position is outside the boundaries, it's game over (return -1).
- If the new location has food, remove that eaten food from its queue and place the next food on the map (if any).
- If the new position doesn't have food, remove the tail of the snake since it moved.
- If the snake new position hits itself, game over (return -1). To make this check, we have 2 options:
    ** Queue: we can visit all the elements on the snake's queue (body) and check if a new position collides. That's `O(n)`
    ** Set: we can maintain a `set` with all the snake locations, so the check is `O(1)`.
- Move the snake's head to a new location (enqueue)
- Return the score (snake's length - 1);

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/design-snake-game.js[tags=description;solution]
----

As you can see, we opted for using a set to trade speed for memory.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(1)`. Insert/Remove from Queue is constant time. Check for body collisions is `O(1)` when using a set. If instead of a set, you traversed the snake's queue to find a collision, it would be `O(n)`.  Here`n` is the snake's max length, which is the screen size (height x width).
- Space: `O(n + m)`. `m` is the number of food items, and `n` is the snake's maximum size (height x width).

=== Solutions for Binary Tree Questions
(((Interview Questions Solutions, Binary Tree)))

:leveloffset: -1

[#binary-tree-q-diameter-of-binary-tree]
include::content/part03/binary-search-tree-traversal.asc[tag=binary-tree-q-diameter-of-binary-tree]

We are asked to find the longest path on a binary tree that might or might not pass through the root node.

We can calculate the height (distance from root to farthest leaf) of a binary tree using this recursive function:

[source, javascript]
----
function getHeight(node) {
  if (!node) return 0;
  const leftHeight = getHeight(node.left);
  const rightHeight = getHeight(node.right);
  return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
}
----

That function will give us the height from the furthest leaf to the root. However, the problem says that it might or might not go through the root.
In that case, we can keep track of the maximum distance (`leftHeight + rightHeight`) seen so far.

*Algorithm*:

- Initialize diameter to `0`
- Recursively find the height of the tree from the root.
- Keep track of the maximum diameter length seen so far (left + right).
- Return the diameter.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/diameter-of-binary-tree.js[tags=description;solution]
----

We are using `Math.max` to keep track of the longest diameter seen.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`, where `n` is each of the tree nodes. We visite each one once.
- Space: `O(n)`. We use `O(1)` variables, but because we are using the `height` recursive function, we use the implicit call stack, thus `O(n)`.




[#binary-tree-q-binary-tree-right-side-view]
include::content/part03/binary-search-tree-traversal.asc[tag=binary-tree-q-binary-tree-right-side-view]

The first thing that might come to mind when you have to visit a tree, level by level, is BFS.
We can visit the tree using a Queue and keep track when a level ends, and the new one starts.

Since during BFS, we dequeue one node and enqueue their two children (left and right), we might have two levels (current and next one). For this problem, we need to know what the last node on the current level is.

.There are several ways to solve this problem using BFS. Here are some ideas:
- *1 Queue + Sentinel node*: we can use a special character in the `Queue` like `'*'` or `null` to indicate the level's change. So, we would start something like this `const queue = new Queue([root, '*']);`.
- *2 Queues*: using a "special" character might be seen as hacky, so you can also opt to keep two queues: one for the current level and another for the next level.
- *1 Queue + size tracking*: we track the Queue's `size` before the children are enqueued. That way, we know where the current level ends.

We are going to implement BFS with "1 Queue + size tracking", since it's arguably the most elegant.

*Algorithm*:

- Enqueue root
- While the queue has an element
    ** Check the current size of the queue
    ** Dequeue only `size` times, and for each dequeued node, enqueue their children.
    ** Check if the node is the last one in its level and add it to the answer.

*Implementation*:

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/binary-tree-right-side-view.js[tags=description;solution]
----

This problem is also possible to be solved using DFS. The trick is to start with the right child and add it to the solution when it is the first one on its level.

[source, javascript]
----
include::interview-questions/binary-tree-right-side-view.js[tag=dfs]
----

The complexity of any of the BFS methods or DFS is similar.

*Complexity Analysis*:

- Time: `O(n)`. We visit every node, once.
- Space: `O(n)`. For BFS, the worst-case space is given by the maximum *width*. That is when the binary tree is complete so that the last level would have `(n-1)/2` nodes, thus `O(n)`. For the DFS, the space complexity will be given by the tree's maximum *height*. In the worst-case, the binary tree is skewed to the right so that we will have an implicit call stack of size `n`.
