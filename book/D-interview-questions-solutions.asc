==== Rotate Left

We are asked to rotate an array multiple times (`k`).

One brute force solution, would be removing the first element and appending it to the end `k` times:

However, what would happen if the array is huge (millions of elements)?
How efficient will be if `k` number is large (thousands)?

When k is bigger than the array, it will loop back over and over again. We can avoid extra computation by calculating the final place using modulus.

Here's the final solution:

It runs on `O(n^2)` while the brute force solution was doing `O(n^2 * k)`.
